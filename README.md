## FAQs
### What is this coded in?
For the time being, this project is entirely coded in Python.
### Is this a club or school project?
This project is not directly affiliated with RHS or an RHS Club.
### Why am I getting a TypeError?
If you are recieving a TypeError, it is most likely that you have not downloaded the "Program Info.txt" file and placed it under "C:/Users" on your computer. This file is a dependency for the code to run, as it contains certain program aesthetics that are read from the file and printed to command line.
### What did you use to convert a .py file to a .exe?
I used pyinstaller.
